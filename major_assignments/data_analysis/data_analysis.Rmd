#Loading Data
```{r echo=FALSE}
census_api_key("ab0ed8418e6554d3eb77ed342784e3bb0b002a64")#, install=TRUE)

```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(janitor)
library(tidycensus)
library(tigris)
library(lubridate)
```
```{r}
census_data <- read_csv("data/census_incarceration.csv")
```

The data doesn't seem to need any cleaning. Will re-evaluate as we do more explanation, but all the numbers, titles, and labels seem explanatory and consistent.

#Analysis of the data
The data has 3,211 rows and 9 columns. Each county for every state has the total population and incarcerated population for 2020, 2010 and 2000, and its FIPS code.
